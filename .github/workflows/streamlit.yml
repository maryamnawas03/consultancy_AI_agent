# This file is automatically used by Streamlit Cloud when connected to GitHub

# No additional configuration needed - Streamlit Cloud will:
# 1. Detect this is a Streamlit app
# 2. Install requirements.txt
# 3. Run the app using: streamlit run app/ui.py

# For manual deployment instructions, see README.md
